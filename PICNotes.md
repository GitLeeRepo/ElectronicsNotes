## PIC Overview

Excerpts from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers):

**PIC** (usually pronounced as "pick") is a **family of microcontrollers** made by **Microchip Technology**, derived from the **PIC1650**.  The name **PIC** initially referred to **Peripheral Interface Controller**, then it was corrected as **Programmable Intelligent Computer**.

Early models of PIC had **read-only memory (ROM)** or **field-programmable EPROM for program storage**, some with provision for **erasing memory**. All **current models use flash memory** for program storage, and newer models allow the PIC to reprogram itself. **Program memory and data memory are separated**. **Data memory** is **8-bit**, **16-bit**, and in latest models, **32-bit** wide. **Program instructions** vary in bit-count by family of PIC, and may be **12, 14, 16, or 24 bits long**. The instruction set also varies by model, with **more powerful chips adding instructions for digital signal processing** functions.

The **hardware capabilities** of **PIC** devices range from 6-pin SMD, 8-pin DIP chips up to 144-pin SMD chips, with discrete I/O pins, **ADC** and **DAC modules**, and **communications ports** such as **UART**, **I2C**, **CAN**, and even **USB**. **Low-power** and **high-speed** variations exist for many types.

The manufacturer supplies **computer software for development known as MPLAB X**, **assemblers** and **C/C++ compilers**, and **programmer/debugger hardware** under the **MPLAB** and **PICKit** series. Third party and some open-source tools are also available. Some parts have **in-circuit programming capability**; low-cost development programmers are available as well as high-production programmers.

### Device Families

**PIC micro chips** are designed with a Harvard architecture, and are offered in various **device families**. The **baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory**, and the **high-end families use 16-bit data memory**. The latest series, **PIC32MZ is a 32-bit MIPS-based microcontroller**. **Instruction words** are in sizes of **12-bit (PIC10 and PIC12)**, **14-bit (PIC16)** and **24-bit (PIC24 and dsPIC)**. The binary representations of the machine instructions vary by family and are shown in PIC instruction listings.

Within these **families**, devices may be designated **PICnnCxxx (CMOS)** or **PICnnFxxx (Flash)**. **"C" devices** are generally classified as **"Not suitable for new development"** (not actively promoted by Microchip). The program memory of "C" devices is variously described as OTP, ROM, or EEPROM. As of October 2016, the only OTP product classified as "In production" is the pic16HV540. "C" devices with quartz windows (for erasure), are in general no longer available.

#### PIC10 and PIC12

These devices feature a **12-bit wide code memory**, a **32-byte register file**, and a **tiny two level deep call stack**. They are represented by the **PIC10** series, as well as by some **PIC12** and **PIC16** devices. Baseline devices are available in 6-pin to 40-pin packages.

#### PIC16

These devices feature a **14-bit wide code memory**, and an improved **8-level deep call stack**. The instruction set differs very little from the baseline devices, but the two additional opcode bits allow **128 registers** and **2048 words of code to be directly addressed**. There are a few additional miscellaneous instructions, and two additional 8-bit literal instructions, add and subtract. The mid-range core is available in the majority of devices labeled **PIC12** and **PIC16**.

#### PIC17

The **17 series never became popular** and has been **superseded** by the **PIC18** architecture (however, see clones below). The 17 series is not recommended for new designs, and availability may be limited to users.

Improvements over earlier cores are **16-bit wide opcodes** (allowing **many new instructions**), and a **16-level deep call stack**. **PIC17** devices were produced in packages from 40 to 68 pins.

The **17 series** introduced a number of important new features:

* a memory mapped accumulator
* read access to code memory (table reads)
* direct register to register moves (prior cores needed to move registers through the accumulator)
* an external program memory interface to expand the code space
* an 8-bit Ã— 8-bit hardware multiplier
* a second indirect register pair
* auto-increment/decrement addressing controlled by control bits in a status register (ALUSTA)
* A significant limitation was that RAM space was limited to 256 bytes (26 bytes of special function registers, and 232 bytes of general-purpose RAM), with awkward bank-switching in the models that supported more.

#### PIC18

In 2000, Microchip introduced the **PIC18** architecture. Unlike the 17 series, it has proven to be **very popular**, with a large number of device variants presently in manufacture. In contrast to earlier devices, which were more often than not programmed in assembly, **C has become the predominant development language**.

The **18 series** inherits **most of the features and instructions of the 17** series, while adding a number of important **new features**:

* **call stack is 21 bits wide and much deeper (31 levels deep)**
* the **call stack** may be **read and written** (TOSU:TOSH:TOSL registers)
* **conditional branch instructions**
* indexed addressing mode (PLUSW)
* extending the **FSR registers to 12 bits**, allowing them to linearly address the entire data address space
* the **addition of another FSR register** (bringing the number up to **3**)
