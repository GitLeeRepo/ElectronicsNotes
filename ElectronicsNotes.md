# Digital and Analog Electronics

* **Analog Electronics** -- involves **smoothly varying signals**.  **Signals** that can take on **varying voltages** or other characteristics. On a **scope** they are represented by **sine waves** and other **continuously varying wave types**.
* **Digital Electronics** -- involves a **fixed voltage** that varies between **on/off** states.  On a **scope** they are represented by **square waves** that are either **on** or **off**.  In reality, **digital electronics** is built on **analog electronics** it is just a **model** that sits on top of it.

## Analog Electronics

### Types of parts

* **resistors** --  **resists current**, **drops voltages**
* **capacitors** -- **stores electrical charge**
* **inductors/coils** -- **store/transfer electromagnetic energy**
* **diodes** -- a **semi-conductor device** that allows **current to flow in one direction only**
* **transistors** -- a **semi-conductor device** that is used as **amplifiers** and **switches**
* **batteries** -- **source** of electrical **current** / **voltage generators**
* **wires** -- used as **conductors** so that electrical **current** and **signals** flow from on **electrical element to another**.
